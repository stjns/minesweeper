Minesweeper

What happened with a software engineering manager that misses programming had an evening to myself. 
The initial version was written in about 2 hours with some very rusty programming skills. About
an hour of refinement has gone in since then. 

I'm currently using Parcel, so to run

`npm i`
then
`npx parcel index.html`
