Minesweeper

What happened when a software engineering manager that misses programming had an evening to myself. 
The initial version was written in about 2 hours with some very rusty programming skills. It's had
about four hours of work total at this point. 

TODO
1. better win/lose logic/actions
2. convenience feature to mark multiple flags at once
3. mobile optimization/controls
4. actual styling
5. ability to generate a "no guess" version
6. win when all mines are marked
7. mine counter

I'm currently using Parcel, so to run

`npm i`
then
`npx parcel index.html`
