# minesweeper

What happened when a software engineering manager that misses programming had an evening to myself. 
The initial version was written in about 2 hours with some very rusty programming skills. It's had
about four hours of work total at this point. 

TODO
- better win/lose actions
- actual styling
- ability to generate a "no guess" version
- enforcement/error handling for width/height/mines
